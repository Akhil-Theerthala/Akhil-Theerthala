## Introduction

Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Akhil Theerthala and I am a final year student at IIT Kharagpur, and an ML enthusiast.

On my profile, you'll find a variety of projects that I've worked on, including:
* Social Media Engagement prediction for news articles ([here](https://github.com/Akhil-Theerthala/Engagement-analysis-for-news-posts))
* Disaster Response Pipeline using python ([here](https://github.com/Akhil-Theerthala/Disaster-Response-Udacity-Project))
* Analysis of Seattle Airbnb Dataset ([here](https://github.com/Akhil-Theerthala/Seattle-Airbnb-Analysis))

I am also interested in collaborating on NLP projects and am always eager to learn new things. If you have any NLP projects that you think I could contribute to, or if you have any recommendations for resources or opportunities to learn more about NLP, please don't hesitate to reach out.

You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/akhil-theerthala) or contact me by email at akhiltvsn@gmail.com. I'm always open to discussing new ideas and opportunities.

Thanks for stopping by!
